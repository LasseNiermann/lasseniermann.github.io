# Privacy Policy

This document entails the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when adding any of the following bots to a server, or as a member of such a server. This document does not supersede the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal).

### Terminology

* **Server Member** - Anyone who is a member of server to which one of the bots has been added



### Data Collected By Command
The following items may be collected and stored when intentionally provided by a user (usually by means of a command). This data will not be collected automatically. When providing data in this way, you forego any rights to the content of the data provided.
* Server configurations (welcome channel, welcome message, volume setting)
* Data and content for automated tasks (personalized volume settings)
* Saved references, urls, or text (playlists)
* Date, Time, Server Name, and Server ID of song requests
* Special user flags such as "Developer"
* Special server glags such as "Nitro"



### Data Collected When Enabled
These items will be automatically collected if a bot is configured to perform certain actions by a server manager. These features are always opt-in, and thus this data will not be collected unless the corresponding feature is enabled.
* Logs of chat messages (serverlogs)



### Data Collected Automatically
This data may be collected automatically by some bots. This data is used to provide statistics or history data. For any bots that collect this data, it is necessary for features of said bot.
* Any data needed for standard operation of Discord bots, such as server permissions (this data is stored in cache only while the bot is running)



### Data Storage
All stored data is kept on protected servers. While storage methods vary, most data is kept within password-protected databases. Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can ever be 100% secure. All efforts are taken to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.



### Feedback
Feedback on any and all provided bots and services is appreciated. When you submit comments, suggestions, bug reports, and any other forms of feedback, you forego any rights to the content, title, or intent of the provided feedback. Additionally, the feedback may be utilized in any way.



### Agreement
By adding any of the listed bots to your server or using these bots or services in any way, you are consenting to the policies outlined in this document. In addition, you (the server manager) are agreeing to inform your members of the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal) and the contents of this document. If you, the server manager, do not agree to this document, you may remove the bot(s) from the server. If you, the server member, do not agree to this document, you may leave the server that contains the bot(s).
